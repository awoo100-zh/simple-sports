# Problem Statement
Building, managing and running a website is complex and expensive, and being a player/coach/manager it is difficult to find up-to-date information in a timely manner. The vision is a one-click install website (or potentially a cloud based option) so that sports clubs and their governing bodies have a central platform for managing their c

# Our Purpose
Let's make life easier for amateur clubs and take the pain away from managing their web presence, and give them access to capabilities that they haven't seen before. Let's help create a consistent experience for our players, clubs and managers and simplify co-ordination efforts across the board. Most importantly, lets create an even playing field to increase competition and competitiveness across the sporting landscape. 

# Simple Sports
Having been an active participant in Sports since the early age of 5, obtaining visibility of information and a nice experience with my club website was near impossible. Simple sports aims to enable sports governing bodies and clubs to simply build, run and administer, supported by an open-source community to quickly fix any bugs or issues.

# Contribution
All contribution is greatly appreciated. Below is a list of the numerous ways you can contribute:

## Design and UAT
Since we are looking to undertake this project from a service design perspective, we are keen to talk to as many possible from the sporting community. You don't have to be a developer, you just have to be a person! Maybe you are a coach, a parent, a manager, a club or governing committee administrator, or maybe you've never played sports before and there is something we can do to help you get involved!

We are looking for input from people in the sporting community, whether you are a player/coach/manager/administrator etc. There are two ways in which you can contribute:
1. You can contribute a feature request to the Trello Board (Coming Soon)(TODO: Update with Link)
1. You can register for an interview or working session to help understand your needs in more depth, and help us tailor a more dynamic experience!
1. Since you are our future users, you could also help us when we come to UAT your user stories

## Code
Since life is busy, and we need to balance paid work, family, health and our hobbies, Code is where we can significantly use your help. Once the initial code platform is up, lets get cracking. The Story Workflow and Backlog is explained in the WIKI (TODO: Update with Link).

We will most likely run two branches: (Open to feedback on this approach as well)
1. Feature Branch - In the early stages this will be the only branch until we reach an MVP that is viable for release.
1. Issue Branch - a Branch for bug fixes in the previous release.

## Documentation
At the moment, we don't have much... just a ReadMe file, containing an introduction to the project, and an automatically generated license document. To this end Documentation isn't a huge area where we require support right now, but keep an eye out because we'll need support soon to support our contributors getting their head around the solution/platform.

I'm working on a Trello Board that will be used to track the development work that takes place. And I'll probably do the initial commit with a starter for 10 website later this week.

Eventually, we would like some Documentation to help clubs set up their websites, and administer these on an on-going basis.

## Chinafication
Also, I would welcome any people who were willing to contribute with regards to making the experience more "Chinafied". Any tasks such as Chinese Language translation, documentation writing, or WeChat development would be greatly appreciated!

# Technologies
I'm open to suggestions about what Technology we could use to pull this together. I'm most experienced with C# MVC, but I'm also keen to explore other technologies such as JSP/PHP or others.
